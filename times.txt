Record the size of your database (in bytes).
Record the size of your development log.
Give at least one method (feel free to Google) for reducing the size of one of these, yet keeping your data intact.
  * Data compression can help reduce the size of your database. Columns that compress well are:
    * Columns with numeric or fixed-length character data types where most values don’t require all the allocated bytes: For example, integers where most values are less than 1000
    * Nullable columns where a significant number of the rows have a NULL value for the column
    * Significant amounts of repeating data values or repeating prefix values in the data
Do you think that this is smaller, about right, or larger than the size of databases you'll be working with in your career?
  * Probably about right to smaller.
